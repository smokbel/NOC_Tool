          <p>Info about YJC: Youth Job Connection was developed as part of the governmentâ€™s major reinvestment in the Ontario Youth Jobs Strategy, as well as its initiative to modernize and transform employment and training programs and services to make them evidence-based, better coordinated, more targeted and more effective for people across the province, including young people.</p>

          <p>The Youth Job Connection program serves youth aged 15 to 29 who experience multiple and/or complex barriers to employment by providing more intensive supports beyond traditional job search and placement opportunities.

          <p>Supports include: <br/>

          <p>Paid pre-employment training to promote job-readiness;<br/>
          Job matching and paid job placements, with placement supports for participants and hiring incentives for employers;<br/>
          Mentorship services; and <br/>
          Education and work transitions supports.<br/>
					<p>What kind of jobs do YJC clients end up working in? How does this differ per region? The following data portrays the occupations of over 14,000 previously-NEET Youth across Ontario, who are participating in Youth Job Connection.</p>
